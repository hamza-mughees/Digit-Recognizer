# Digit Recognizer

This project uses convolutional neural networks to recognize hand-written digits on a Tkinter canvas.

The project uses the MNIST dataset to train the neural network and, after training, saves it into a folder by the name 'mnist.h5py'.

**NOTE:** In order for the program to work, make sure to set the scale and layout size to 100%, which is in the display settings. At any other size, the program seems to not capture the image of the hand-written digit, but rather somewhere else on the screen. This might shrink the contents of your screen to a miniscule size but there isn't a general work around at this point.
